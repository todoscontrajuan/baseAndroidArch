<b>NewApp v1.1</b><br>
<br>
It doesn't have a name because it was created for you to give it one!<br>
This app makes a simple API call and shows the result. Probably something that someone asked you to do for an interview...

Base kotlin Android app usign:
- Clean Architecture + MVVM
- Retrofit + Coroutines to call https://howtodoandroid.com/ API (just a simple json with a list of movies)
- Hilt
- Architecture components (Viewmodel and LiveData)

Soon (!):
- Navigation to details with Nav component
- Unit tests
